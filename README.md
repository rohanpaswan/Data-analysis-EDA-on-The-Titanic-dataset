# 📊 Data Analysis & EDA on The Titanic Dataset

## 🚢 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights about the passengers and the factors that influenced **survival outcomes** using data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques.

The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization, with theoretical explanations at each step. The main work is presented in a Jupyter notebook.

📜 About the Titanic Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains demographic and survival information for the passengers of the RMS Titanic. It is one of the most popular datasets for learning data analysis and machine learning techniques.

🧠 What You Will Learn

* This project answers questions such as:

* Which passenger features impact survival?

* What is the distribution of key variables like age, fare, class, and gender?

* How does survival rate vary by demographics?

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used:

* Python

* Pandas – Data manipulation

* NumPy – Numerical computation

* Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

* Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding environment

📌 Key Steps in the Analysis

1 Data Loading
-Load the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2 Understanding the Data
-Check the shape, columns, and summary statistics of the dataset.

3 Data Cleaning

-Identify and handle missing data.

-Fix inconsistent formats.

4 Exploratory Data Analysis

-Analyze demographic patterns.

-Visualize survival rates based on different features (e.g., class, gender, age groups).

5 Data Visualization

-Use plots like histograms, bar plots, count plots, and heatmaps to visualize insights.

📊 Insights & Highlights

* Age and fare distributions vary widely among passenger classes.

* Female passengers had higher survival rates than males.

* Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival.

* Missing values, especially in columns like Cabin and Age, are handled appropriately.
