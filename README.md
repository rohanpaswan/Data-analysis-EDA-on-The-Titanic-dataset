# 📊 Data Analysis & EDA on The Titanic Dataset

## 🚢 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights about the passengers and the factors that influenced **survival outcomes** using data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques.

The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization, with theoretical explanations at each step. The main work is presented in a Jupyter notebook.
